# Laravel Splade

***The magic of Inertia.js with the simplicity of Blade.***

Splade provides a **super easy** way to build ***Single Page Applications*** (SPA) using standard **Laravel Blade** templates, enhanced with renderless **Vue 3** components. In essence, you can write your app using the simplicity of Blade, and besides that magic SPA-feeling, you can sparkle it to make it interactive. **All without ever leaving Blade.**

## Features

Splade gives you a massive head start when building applications. Navigate the documentation or watch the videos to discover its power, but to give you a glance, here's a short overview of some of the best features:

* Splade allows you to use the Laravel Blade template engine and build a single-page application using regular server-side routing without building an API. You still have the full power of Vue.js when you need it.
* Splade aims to stick as close as possible to the default Laravel features and development flow.
* Automatic installer and support for the Laravel Breeze starter kit.
* Besides the SPA navigation features, it has more than 20 interactive components that are huge timesavers.
* Most components are functional and unstyled, giving you complete control over the implementation.
* Other components are styled with Tailwind CSS 3.0, but can be fully customized by publishing the Blade templates. You don't need to rebuild or recompile *any* JavaScript for this.
* Built-in support for Modals and Slideover that can show any route or pre-loaded content.
* Beautiful Form Components with support for Validation and (Eloquent) Model binding. Built-in integration with Autosize, Choices.js, FilePond, and Flatpickr, including async file uploads.
* DataTables-like Table component that supports auto-fill, bulk actions, exports, searching, sorting, and more!
* Support Lazy Loading (templates and data), Persistent Layout, Animations, and Teleports.
* Laravel Echo integration to control browser behavior from the backend (redirecting, refreshing, and showing a toast).
* Built-in SEO (title, description, keywords) with support for Open Graph and Twitter tags.
* Support for custom Blade and Vue components.
* Support for existing Blade and Vue libraries.
* Support for SSR (server-side rendering).
