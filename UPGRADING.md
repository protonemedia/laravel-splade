# From v0.1 to v0.2

* There's a new Blade `@spladeHead` directive to support title and meta tags. You may add this directive to your root template.
* Splade now supports SSR. This is optional, so you may follow the [manual installation guide](https://splade.dev/docs/ssr) to set up SSR.
* The new SSR feature includes a *Blade Fallback* option, which is enabled by default. You may disable it in the `splade.php` configuration file.
