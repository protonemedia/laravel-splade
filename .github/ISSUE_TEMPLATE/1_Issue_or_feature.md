<!-- Fill out the FULL versions with patch versions -->

- Laravel Version: #.#.#
- PHP Version: #.#.#
- Splade JS Version (npm): #.#.#
- Splade PHP Version (composer): #.#.#
- Dev environment (OS, Sail/Valet/etc): ...

You may use the [built-in Artisan Command](https://splade.dev/docs/upgrading) to show the installed versions of the packages:

```bash
php artisan splade:show-versions
```

Make sure both Splade packages (JS + PHP) are up-to-date and on the same version. For example, when using version 0.5.0 of the PHP package, you should use the same JavaScript package version.
